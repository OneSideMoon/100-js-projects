# 100 Days of JavaScript

Welcome to the **100 JavaScript Projects** repository! This repository is a collection of small JavaScript projects designed to help you learn and master JavaScript. Each project focuses on a different aspect of JavaScript and web development, from simple utilities to more complex applications.


## The Rules

- I will do 100 small JavaScript projects.
- There's no time limit on how long an individual exercise can take.
- Perfect is the enemy of good. I will not be afraid of making mistakes.
- I will ask for help when I need it.
